Important Tissue Culture Practices
===================================
- Wash your hands before and after working with cell cultures.
- Clean pipettes, pipette aids, markers, tube racks, and the work surface immediately before and after use using 70% EtOH.
- When handling mammalian cells always work in the Biosafety cabinet.
- Before starting your cell culture work, open the Biosafety cabinets and let the laminar air flow run for 5-10 minutes.
- Spray the cabinet with 70% ethanol and let sit for 1-2 mins then wipe your work surface using kimwipes (not paper towels).
- Always wear a lab coat and gloves when working in the BS cabinet.
- Only have items you need in the BS cabinet- Having too many items in the BS cabinet interrupts the laminar air flow and can cause contaminants to be introduced into the BS cabinet.
- Do not place items on the BS cabinet grill- this created a gap in the air laminar flow.
- Always keep reagent bottles, tubes and culture dishes/flasks closed when not in use.
- Any spillage inside and outside of the hood should be immediately wiped up and cleaned.
- Be sure you are working INSIDE the BS cabinet- not on or above the grill.
- Do not work above/over open reagents/ bottle capsâ€¦ etc. Open containers should be put far away from you such that no work is done above/over them.
- Do not use your phone or computer while handling cells- this leads to contaminations!
- All TC room equipment (e.g., tube racks, timers, EtOH bottles, gloves) should stay in the TC room. Also, outside equipment should not be brought into the TC  room unless absolutely necessary.
- Do not discard your culture with the media in them, aspirate media before putting them in the Biohazard waste.
- In order to minimize contamination and cross contamination, ethanol should be run through the aspirator tip after use.
- Always check the media and cells before using the BS cabinet - turbid media usually means that the culture is contaminated.
- If your culture is contaminated:

    i.  Discard it immediately in a biohazard waste bin and close and change the bin. Change your gloves immediately. Decontaminate any surfaces the contaminated culture came into contact with using bleach or ethanol.
    ii. Clean any surfaces in the incubator where the contaminated culture was stored (Do not directly spray ethanol in the incubator, instead wet a Kimwipe with ethanol and clean the surface). 
    iii. Check the media bottle you used for the contaminated culture - if suspicious, discard the media. Change gloves again and continue working with the rest of your cultures.
