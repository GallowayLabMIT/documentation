Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) Aliquots
------------------------------------
- FBS contains many nutrients and growth factors to support cell growth. To preserve FBS, it is usually stored in the -20C freezer until used. To avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles of FBS and to prevent contaminations we make FBS aliquots.
- Thaw 500mL FBS bottle in the fridge overnight
- Make 10 aliquots of 50mL each. Be sure to stop at the 50mL mark. Having larger volumes may cause the FBS to overflow (and be contaminated) when frozen again (FBS volume expands when frozen).
- Store aliquots in -20C freezer in the TC room.
- Take responsibility for aliquoting new stocks, when older stocks are almost used up. Make sure to use sterile technique in preparing aliquots.

Pen-strep aliquots
---------------------
- Penicillin-streptomycin is a mixture of penicillin and streptomycin and is added to the media to prevent bacterial contamination. However, it is always important to be very careful when handling cultures as contamination may still occur even when pen-strep is added.
- Thaw 50mL pen-strep bottle in the fridge overnight
- Pen-strep is aliquoted into 5mL aliquots and stored in the TC -20C until used.
- Take responsibility for aliquoting new stocks, when older stocks are almost used up. Make sure to use sterile technique in preparing aliquots.

Preparation of basic 2D cell culture media ( DMEM + 10% FBS +1% Pen-strep)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Thaw 50mL of FBS and 5mL of penicillin-streptomycin aliquots.
- To a 500mL DMEM bottle, add 50mL of FBS and 5mL of penicillin-streptomycin.
- Mix solution and store in 4C in the TC room.

Note: this media mixture is commonly used but it is not the only type of media used for
2D cell culture. You should find out the recommended type of media used for the culture
of the cell type you are using.
