Virus concentration
===================

.. time::
	1 hour in-TC time, 1 day overnight time

Protocol
--------
1.	Filter virus through a 0.45um syringe filter into a 50ml conical.  This eliminates any 293T cells that may have been carried over/collected in media.
2.	Add 1/3 volume of Lenti-X concentrator (if 30ml virus, add 10ml Lenti-X).  Will be approximately 8.7-9ml.  Mix by inverting several times.
3.	Store at 4°C for 24 hours (or overnight).
4.	Centrifuge at 1500 x g at 4°C for 45 minutes, then remove the supernatant, careful to leave ~200-300ul media.  For dsRed, remove almost all media, leaving only a minute amount to resuspend the pellet.
5.	Resuspend gently in media using P1000.
6.	Record volume of virus suspension.
7.	Freeze in cryovial at -80°C.
