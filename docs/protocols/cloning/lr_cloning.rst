.. time:: 1 hr

Protocol
========
.. note::
	In most instances, a 5 uL reaction is sufficent.

1. Add 50-150 ng of entry plasmid and 150 ng of destination plasmid. Dilute with water to 4 uL or 8 uL.
2. Thaw LR Clonase II enzyme mix on ice for two minutes. Vortex the enzyme mix briefly (2 seconds each time).
3. Add 1 uL clonase mix for a 5 uL reaction, or 2 uL clonase for a 10 uL reaction.
4. Incubate at 25 degrees C for 1 hour.
5. **Optional, if transforming immediately:** Add 0.5/1.0 uL Proteinase K to each sample to terminate the reaction. Incubate at 37 degrees C for 10 minutes.
6. Transform competent cells.

Expected results
================
An efficent reaction will produce > 5000 colonies, if the entire volume is transformed and plated.
