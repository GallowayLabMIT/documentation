	FINISH CONVERTING

Day One:
1.	Seed Plat-E cells onto 6 well plates after gelatin coating. Place in 37Â°C incubator.

Day Two:
1.  	Make a mastermix of PEI and Knockout DMEM as follows (MM for 1 well/each virus):
a.	For ONE WELL of 6 well plate, add 7.2 uls PEI (1mg/ml; 4 PEI:1 ug DNA ratio) TO 180 uls Knockout DMEM in a 1.5ml tube, mix, let sit for 5 minutes. 
b.	Note: PEI optimal concentration varies by batch and must be tested before transfection. Current batch 4:1 (typical range 4:1 to 6:1). 

c.	CRUCIAL TO ADD PEI TO THE DMEM AND NOT THE OTHER WAY!!

d.	MAKE UP ENOUGH FOR 1.5 RXNS, 10.8 uls PEI TO 270 uls KO DMEM

2.	Add DNA to this MM as follows, then mix and wait 15 minutes:
a.	1.8 ug DNA/well, make enough for 1.5 rxns (e.g. 
b.	
Vector	Target Conc (ug)	Target Conc, 1.5rxns (ug)	Target Vol, 1.5rxns (ul)
Ascl1 (3.06 ug/ul)	1.8	2.7	0.88
Brn2 (2.36 ug/ul)	1.8	2.7	1.14
Mytl-1(4.2 ug/ul)	1.8	2.7	0.64
			
			

3.	Add 187 uL of the 270 uL PEI+DMEM+DNA mix to each of WELL PER VIRUS DROPWISE and evenly around the plate, rocking the plate back and forth, side to side to mix. Place back in incubator.

Day Three:
4.	24 hours after addition of PEI mixes to Plat-E, change media with 1.25mls fresh media (DMEM + 10% FBS + 1% Pen/Strep).

5.	Seed MEFs at 5-10K cells per well of 96-well plate. For larger sizes, scale accordingly (e.g. 96 well size is about 1/16 of 6-well, seed 80K for 6 well). 

Day Four:
6.	24 hours after media change, harvest media for TRANSDUCTION!






Transduction of Hb9:GFP Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts

Day Four: 
(Note: one 6-well = 16* one 96-well)
1.	Transduce MEFs with retroviruses made from the Plat-E cells

a.	Each virus will make ~1.25ml from the 1 well of Plat-E (enough for 1 96-well)
i.	11.375 ul of each virus will be added to each well of a 96well plate ALONG WITH POLYBRENE (5mg/ml, 1000x to total media) 

ii.	Filter each virus through a filter;  all 3 TFs will be filtered through syringe together to simplify adding them each individually to MM combos

b.	Media + virus = 125ul per well of 96well plate

c.	For 1 well of 96 well:

1.	3 TFs alone: 1well/125ul =
11.4 ul EACH Factor (34.2 ul total) + 91.6ul DMEM  + 0.125ul Polybr. = Total volume 125 uL

d.	For 12 wells of 96 well:
1.	3 TFs alone: 12wells/125ul =
136.8 ul EACH Factor (410 ul) + 1091 ul DMEM  + 1.5 ul Polybr. = Total volume 1.5 mL

2.	Replenish media on Plat-E plates with media for a second time (1.25ml).

Day Five:
3.	Collect media from Plat-Es again and reinfect/re-transduce the plates for a second day.

Day Six:
4.	Change media on transduced MEFs.

Day Seven:
5.	Add glia cells to the transduced plates of fibroblasts.
a.	1 vial of glia = 3 flasks, able to use approximately one flask per FULL PLATE of 96 wells.  
b.	500ul will be added to the 24-well plates.

Day Eight:
6.	Media changed on plates to N3 + 2%FBS + 10ng/ml GDNF, BDNF, and CNTF

Day 10, 12, 14, etc:
7.	Change N3 media until cells are fixed with PFA for staining and imaging.
