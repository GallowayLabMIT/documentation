===================
Plat-E Transfection
===================

Protocol
---------

Day One (seed Plat-Es):

1.	Seed Plat-E cells at 600k cells/well onto 6 well plates after 0.1% gelatin coating. Place in 37°C incubator.

.. tip::
	If starting from frozen, start growing Plat-E cells 1 week prior - they will be slow growing at first

Day Two (transfect Plat-Es):

1.  Make a mastermix (MM) of PEI and Knockout DMEM as follows (MM for 1 well/each virus):

    a.	For *just 1 well of a 6-well plate*:

        i.  In a 1.5 mL tube, FIRST add 180 µL KO DMEM
        ii. SECOND, add 7.2 µL PEI (1 mg/ml) for a 4:1 ratio (of µg PEI:µg DNA ratio).
        iii. Gently flick to mix. Let sit for 5 minutes.

    b.	For *3.5 rxns or wells of a 6-well plate*, same as above but use 630 µL KO DMEM + 25.2 µL PEI (1 mg/ml) for a 4:1 ratio

.. important::
	Ensure that you **add PEI to KO DMEM**, NOT the other way around!! Also make sure to use KO DMEM as KO DMEM facilitates lipid-mediated transfections (e.g. PEI) which might be disrupted by regular DMEM.

.. note::
    PEI optimal concentration varies by batch and must be tested before transfection. Current batch is 5:1 as of 2020.02.19 (typical range 4:1 to 6:1).

2.	Add DNA to this MM as follows, then mix and wait 15 minutes:

    a.	1.8 µg DNA/well, (or 6.3 µg DNA total for 3.5 rxns)

    =============================   ==============  =================  ====================

3.	Add each KO DMEM + PEI + DNA mix to a single 6-well (1 WELL PER VIRUS) **DROPWISE** and evenly around the plate, rocking the plate back and forth, side to side to mix. Place back in incubator.

Day Three (media change):

4.	Change with 1.25 mLs fresh media (DMEM + 10% FBS) after 24 hours.
5.	Seed MEFs at 5-10K cells per well of 96-well plate. For larger sizes, scale accordingly (e.g. 96 well size is about 1/16 of 6-well, seed 80K for 6 well).

Day Four (infect 1):

6.	Harvest media after another 24 hours and PROCEED TO TRANSDUCTION!



=====================================================
Transduction of Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs)
=====================================================

Day Four:

(Note: one 6-well = 16* one 96-well)
1.	Transduce MEFs with retroviruses made from the Plat-E cells

a.	Each virus will make ~1.25ml from the 1 well of Plat-E (enough for 1 96-well)
i.	11.375 ul of each virus will be added to each well of a 96well plate ALONG WITH POLYBRENE (5mg/ml, 1000x to total media)

ii.	Filter each virus through a filter;  all 3 TFs will be filtered through syringe together to simplify adding them each individually to MM combos

b.	Media + virus = 125ul per well of 96well plate

c.	For 1 well of 96 well:

1.	3 TFs alone: 1well/125ul =
11.4 ul EACH Factor (34.2 ul total) + 91.6ul DMEM  + 0.125ul Polybr. = Total volume 125 uL

d.	For 12 wells of 96 well:
1.	3 TFs alone: 12wells/125ul =
136.8 ul EACH Factor (410 ul) + 1091 ul DMEM  + 1.5 ul Polybr. = Total volume 1.5 mL

2.	Replenish media on Plat-E plates with media for a second time (1.25ml).

Day Five:

3.	Collect media from Plat-Es again and reinfect/re-transduce the plates for a second day.

Day Six:

4.	Change media on transduced MEFs.

Day Seven:

5.	Add glia cells to the transduced plates of fibroblasts.
a.	1 vial of glia = 3 flasks, able to use approximately one flask per FULL PLATE of 96 wells.
b.	500ul will be added to the 24-well plates.

Day Eight:

6.	Media changed on plates to N3 + 2%FBS + 10ng/ml GDNF, BDNF, and CNTF

Day 10, 12, 14, etc:

7.	Change N3 media until cells are fixed with PFA for staining and imaging.
